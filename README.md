# Assembly
A collection of various mini-projects coded in x86-64 GAS/AT&T Assembly.

There is no specific topic which these snippets follow strictly: it's just a _collection_ containing various experiments with Assembly code in hope to help someone trying to approach to this infamous language. 

All the code was created and executed functionally on _Windows 11 and Windows 10_. As of now, there are no snippets designed to work on Linux and/or MacOS. Although the differences are not many, they are enough to compromise any cross-OS attempt of executing the code (in case any .s file were to be re-compiled into a non-MS, platform dependent executable).

Besides covering some very basic operations, some bigger mini-projects are included as well; this may also help by offering some valid examples of how said basic mechanics are applied to more complex schemes and projects.

Every Assembly snippet has been compiled using _as.exe_ and linked creating an executable using _gcc.exe_.
